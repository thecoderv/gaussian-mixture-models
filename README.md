Gaussian Mixture Models vs Kmeans clustering

Generated Data from Multivariate normal distribution(MVN) for two clusters with the following parameters:

Combined both the classes and compared clustering using Gaussian Mixture models and Kmeans

We can see in the plots of Kmeans clustering that there are circular shape clustering. This is because the centroids of the clusters are updated iteratively using the mean value.

Gaussian Mixture Model use the soft clustering approach for distributing the points in different clusters unline Kmeans clustering.

Therefore, for the dataset above we see that Gaussian Mixture Models presents a better solution than the Kmeans model.
